## How does the order work? 

The order works by putting all jokers into a shop queue (this includes bufoon packs/judgement tarot). What this means is if your oppoennt rerolls once in a shop, and you dont, you will see the same shop they did next shop instead of missing out on it. 
There are also seperate shop queues for tarot packs and spectral packs. Things not affected by the order is the wraith spectral, rare tag skips, and RNG factors such as lucky card hits/glass breaking. If you want to learn more about how the order works,

You can also view [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KBxSZaRZm1Dn4BVwJpAaKWpQZU4Ix3Yn7aFLhQZYiKM/edit?usp=sharing) that goes over the various changes made by the mod, including order changes.

## How do I turn on the order?

The Order is on by default in Ranked lobbies, and can otherwise be turned on in other lobbies by going into the advanced lobby settings while in a match.
