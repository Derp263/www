## How does the order work? 

The order works by putting all jokers into a shop queue (this includes bufoon packs/judgement tarot). What this means is if your oppoennt rerolls once in a shop, and you dont, you will see the same shop they did next shop instead of missing out on it. 
There are also seperate shop queues for tarot packs and spectral packs. Things not affected by the order is the wraith spectral, rare tag skips, and RNG factors such as lucky card hits/glass breaking. If you want to learn more about how the order works,

## How do I turn on the order?

You can do so by going into the mod menu in game, clicking on Balatro Multiplayer, clicking on config, and toggle on the order.

## How do I make sure The Order is turned on for me?

In the lobby menu, you can click the numbers next to your name. This shows a list of mods that are on. If you see "TheOrder-MultiplayerIntegration", this means that it is on.
