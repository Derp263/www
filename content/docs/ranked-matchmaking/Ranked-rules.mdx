- All games must be played on the Standard ruleset
- All games must be played on the same seed between players
- All games must be played on the default lobby options
    - This can be changed if both players agree to use different lobby options
- Deck and stake must be chosen by both players using the ban-pick system
    - The bot will send an embedded message with the names of who bans first, second and last
    - The first player to ban chooses which decks to ban (number of bans allowed is in the embedded message)
    - The second player picks a specified number of decks from the remaining decks
    - The first player then picks from those decks
    - Alternatively, both players can agree on a random or selected deck/stake
- You must be using a fully unlocked profile
    - If you do not have a fully unlocked profile, create a new profile and click "Unlock All"
- You must be on the latest version of Multiplayer (refer to [here](https://discord.com/channels/1226193436521267223/1228517235744833566))and have The Order Integration enabled in Mods > Multiplayer > config
- You must not be using any banned mods
    - [⁠approved mods](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o3vC0V6I71ooukutwkLbqZJO8yE1bavdfWs-ztUsF4Y/edit?gid=0#gid=0) has a list of approved and banned mods
    - Generally, speed mods (mods that let you play on speeds higher than 4x or remove animations), content mods (mods that add jokers), and any mods that effect what you would see in the shops, are banned.
- You must not have **debug mode enabled**, having this enabled will get you banned from ranked for an increasing amount of days for each occurrence
- You have to be on the recommended steammodded (506a). Not doing so will result in a strike or win given to your oppoenent. The recomendded steammodded can be found [here](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/archive/refs/tags/1.0.0-beta-0506a.zip)
or installable through the Balatro Multiplayer Launcher.


## Queue rules

- All games are played on the Attrition ruleset
- If there are any problems in your queue match, such as someone not voting, or someone not responding then please ping @The Hierophants [Helper]  for assistance **in queue**
- If a player crashes or disconnects then we follow this policy in terms of resolving the result of the game:
    - If a player crashes or disconnects before the first PvP blind (before ante 2) then the match will be cancelled or a rematch can take place if both players are willing
    - If a player crashes or disconnects after the first PvP blind (>ante2) then the win will be given to the person that did not crash or disconnect
    - If both players loose their final lives on the same ante to a non PvP blind, then the winner is whoever made it furthest into the ante wins.
    - If this system is abused you will be punished
    - If a player is found to not be following this policy then please ping @The Hierophants [Helper] **in queue**
    - Staff has final say and has the power to use their own discretion when deciding the outcome of a game in the event of a dispute


## Queue Etiquette
- Both players have to agree to do random deck/stake. (You can do randomdeck by typing >randomdeck in queue)
- If a player is below gold they get the power to veto and pick white stake.
- If both players are stalling in the pvp blind, then the person with the lower score must play their hand first.
