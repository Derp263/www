If you want to compete in ranked matches in Balatro Multiplayer and make your way to the leaderboards you have two options:

## Ranked Queue

The **Ranked Queue** is the default queue in Balatro Multiplayer. It is a queue where players can compete against other players in a ranked matchmaking system.

One of the main differentiators of the Ranked Queue is that
**it includes changes to the base game balance.**
These changes are meant to make the game **less RNG-heavy and more balanced** for competitive play.


## Ranks

Players start at 200 MMR, and can achieve higher ranks as they gain more MMR.

The ranks are as follows:

- Stone: Lowest rank (Under 250MMR)
- Steel: 250 MMR+
- Gold: 320 MMR+
- Lucky: 460 MMR+
- Glass: 620 MMR+

- Foil: Top 50 players on the leaderboard
- Holographic: Top 10 players on the leaderboard
- Polychrome: Top 5 players on the leaderboard
- Negative: Top 1 player on the leaderboard

You can check your MMR or leaderboard position through the [Open Leaderboards](https://balatromp.com/leaderboards)
