If you want to compete in ranked matches in Balatro Multiplayer and make your way to the leaderboards you have two options:

## Ranked Queue

The **Ranked Queue** is the default queue in Balatro Multiplayer. It is a queue where players can compete against other players in a ranked matchmaking system.

One of the main differentiators of the Ranked Queue is that
**it includes changes to the base game balance.**
These changes are meant to make the game **less RNG-heavy and more balanced** for competitive play.
