- ## Attrition
    - Every boss blind after Ante 1 is a nemesis blind. 

- ## Showdown
    - After the first 2 antes, every blind is a nemesis blind. This gamemode gives you time to prepare before battle.

- ## Survival
    - The player who beats the farthest blind wins. No nemesis blinds. This gamemode is a test of your ability to gradually build-up to the highest scoring vanilla hands.
